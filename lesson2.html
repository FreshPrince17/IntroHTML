    <h2>What is Computing?</h2>
    <p>Computing, in the context of computer science, refers to the process of using computer systems to solve problems.
      This involves the design and use of algorithms (step-by-step procedures), data structures (ways to organize and
      store data), and computer systems (hardware and software) to efficiently process, analyze, or transmit
      information. It's a broad field that includes areas like programming,
      data analysis, artificial intelligence, network design, and more.</p>
